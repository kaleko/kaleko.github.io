## About

I'm a 26 year old graduate student in physics at Columbia University who used to love neutrinos but now loves data science. I'm hoping to develop the necessary skills to get a job in data science after I graduate in about a year. Ideally, I would get a job that allows me to make some sort of direct social impact on the world. Other interest include sleeping, chess, and life away from a computer screen.
